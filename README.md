# FireFly
This circuit simulates a firefly with a tiny microcontroller. If put together with other fireflies, they will flash randomly. But after some time they will start to interact with each other and the flashes will start synchronize until all fireflies flash at once. Based on https://github.com/tinkerlog/fireflies
